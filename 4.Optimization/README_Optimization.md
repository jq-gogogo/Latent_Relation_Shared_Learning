# Optimization for Incomplete Multi-modality Representation Learning

## Overview
 The notebook details the process of alternating updates for the variables V, W, and Uv, following an optimization strategy designed to achieve a local minimum efficiently.

## Model Description
- **Variable Updates**: Implements alternating updates for V, W, and Uv using optimization equations.
- **Sylvester Equation**: Utilizes the Sylvester equation for updating V, providing a systematic approach to solve for this variable.
- **Regularization and Stability**: Includes regularization parameters in the updates for W and Uv to maintain stability and prevent overfitting.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you need the following Python libraries:
- NumPy
- SciPy
