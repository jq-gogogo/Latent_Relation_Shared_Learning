# Multi-modality Representation Learning for Endometrial Cancer Diagnosis

## Overview
The model employs methods to learn a latent subspace using multi-modal data, preserves local geometric structures using a graph Laplacian, and maps to a label-dependent feature space.

## Model Description
- **Latent Subspace Learning**: Utilizes various modalities to extract a common feature space.
- **Graph Laplacian**: Helps in preserving local geometric structures of the data.
- **Label-dependent Feature Space**: Maps the learned features to specific labels aiding in classification tasks.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you need the following Python libraries:
- NumPy
- SciPy
- scikit-learn
