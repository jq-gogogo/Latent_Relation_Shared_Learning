## Stages Included
1. **Data Augmentation**: Increases the diversity of medical images using techniques such as horizontal flipping, vertical flipping, random cropping, contrast adjustment, and noise addition.
2. **Multi-modality Representation Learning**: Learns a latent subspace using multi-modal data while preserving local geometric structures using a graph Laplacian.
3. **Incomplete_Multi_modality_Representation_Learning**: Incorporates incomplete data into the training process to utilize as much available information as possible.
4. **Optimization**: Uses alternating updates for variables V, W, and Uv to achieve a local minimum.
