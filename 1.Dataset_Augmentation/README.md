# Data Augmentation for Endometrial Cancer Diagnosis

## Overview
The techniques include horizontal flipping, vertical flipping, random cropping, contrast adjustment, and noise addition.

## Techniques Included
- **Horizontal Flipping**: Mirrors the image horizontally.
- **Vertical Flipping**: Mirrors the image vertically.
- **Random Cropping**: Randomly crops the image to a smaller size.
- **Contrast Adjustment**: Adjusts the contrast of the image by a random factor.
- **Noise Addition**: Adds random Gaussian noise to the image.

## Requirements
